# SQL Sales Analysis

This project demonstrates SQL skills using a mock retail sales dataset. I worked with three tables (`customers`, `products`, and `orders`) to perform exploratory analysis.  

## Dataset
- `customers` → customer info (ID, name, location)  
- `products` → product catalog (ID, name, category, price)  
- `orders` → order transactions (order ID, customer ID, product ID, date, quantity)  

## Example Queries
- Total number of orders placed  
- Top 5 products by sales  
- Average order value  
- Customers with the highest spend  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Creating tables and importing CSVs into SQL  
- Joining multiple tables  
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

## Results
- Clean, queryable dataset  
- SQL queries for analysis  
- Insights into sales performance
